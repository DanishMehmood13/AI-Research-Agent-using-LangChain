AI Research Agent (FastAPI + React + LangChain) — Personal Project
Built a full‑stack AI research assistant that lets users upload PDFs and ask natural‑language questions about them. 
Implemented a FastAPI backend with OpenRouter (LLM) integration, PDF ingestion (PyMuPDF), chunking, embeddings, and FAISS vector search to power retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG). 
Developed a React frontend with chat UI, PDF upload, and live status polling, handling CORS, async API calls, and error states.
Integrated a tool‑calling agent (LangChain) that can use web search and a custom PDF search tool to answer user queries with relevant context.
